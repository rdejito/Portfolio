# Hi! I'm Rainiel and this is my Web Portfolio
I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Engineering Technology Student in a Technical-Vocational school.

My journey in web development started when I graduated in senior high school.
Before the semester starts at my applied tech-voc school, I studied web development online from Web3School and Codecademy.
Well, my first semester was kinda... Peaceful? I say. Almost no coding and my schedule we're kind of a lot of free time and no discussions.
Time skip to my 3rd semester where a lot of coding stuff started (Our batch we're kinda delayed of the topic) it was the time I really started to create a
personal portfolio as a project for our final exam. Racking up my brains and all because of being not a technology student (ICT) before but, from those classmates
that came from an ICT background, I can say that in terms of what I know about development and stuff, not as kind of boasting but I supercede them in that regard.

Well, enough if that :).
Please feel free to check my portfolio and if you have some comments about it.. recommendation? suggestion?
It would be my pleasure to have your thoughts :).

Oh, and pardon me if the reponsiveness of this portfolio is downright bad, I'm in the process of fixing it.
